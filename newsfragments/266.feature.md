Added a builtin function `abi_encode()` that can be used to encode stucts. The return type is a 
fixed-size array of bytes that is equal in size to the encoding. The type system does not support 
dynamically-sized arrays yet, which is why we used fixed.

Example:

```
struct House:
    price: u256
    size: u256
    rooms: u8
    vacant: bool
    
contract Foo:
    pub def hashed_house() -> u256:
        house: House = House(
            price=300,
            size=500,
            rooms=u8(20),
            vacant=true
        )
        return keccak256(house.abi_encode())
```
