Support for contract creations.

Example of `create2`, which takes a `value` and address `salt` as parameters.

```
contract Foo:
    pub def get_my_num() -> u256:
        return 42

contract FooFactory:
    pub def create2_foo() -> address:
        # value and salt
        foo: Foo = Foo.create2(0, 52)
        return address(foo)
```

Example of `create`, which just takes a `value` parameter.

```
contract Foo:
    pub def get_my_num() -> u256:
        return 42

contract FooFactory:
    pub def create_foo() -> address:
        # value and salt
        foo: Foo = Foo.create(0)
        return address(foo)
```

*Note: We do not yet support init parameters.*
