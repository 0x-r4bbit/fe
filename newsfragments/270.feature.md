Support for the boolean operations `and` and `or`.

Examples:

```
contract Foo:
    pub def bar(x: bool, y: bool) -> bool:
        return x and y
```

```
contract Foo:
    pub def bar(x: bool, y: bool) -> bool:
        return x or y
```

Support for `self.address`.

This expression returns the address of the current contract.

Example:

```
contract Foo:
    pub def bar() -> address:
        return self.address
```
